Things I learned with this project: 

    gdb: 
        Compile you code with -g flag to use gdb. gdb can help you find memory leaks and where segmentation errors occur

        How to use gdb: 
            Compile with -g flag
            Run gdb with 'gdb' command
            Type 'file <executable>' to open your file in gdb
            Use command 'run' to run your code with gdb and cause a segmentation fault
            Type 'bt' to find problems, alternatively you can also set break points and stuff

    Callgrind/Kcachegrind: 
        These tools can help you find performance issues
    
    .h .cpp files: 
        C++ classes should be defined with a .h file which you can include and a .cpp file with function implementations. 
    
    Keep Code clean: 
        Keep private functions, variables and public functions separate. 
        Separate large classes and include 
        Don't have prin
    
    Position Class: 
        a Position class can be helpful for 2D games. 
        Just make a class with x and y variables. 
        You can add other basic functionality
    
    How to store coordinates: 
        Best to have a Position class and then convert coordinates to a 2d vector. 
        Then print the 2d vector. 
    
    Github: 
        git status 
        git add .
        git push 
        other cmds. 
        Enable Source Control on VScode and then you can see history. 
        Commit and push to github to save repository. 
        Or use desktop github app to push to repository
