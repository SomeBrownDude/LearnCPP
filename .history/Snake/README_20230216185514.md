Things I learned with this project: 

    gdb: 
        Compile you code with -g flag to use gdb. gdb can help you find memory leaks and where segmentation errors occur

        How to use gdb: 
            Compile with -g flag
            Run gdb with 'gdb' command
            Type 'file <executable>' to open your file in gdb
            Use command 'run' to run your code with gdb and cause a segmentation fault
            Type 'bt' to find problems, alternatively you can also set break points and stuff

    Callgrind/Kcachegrind: 
        These tools can help you find performance issues
    
    .h .cpp files: 
        C++ classes should be defined with a .h file which you can include and a .cpp file with function implementations. 
    
    Keep Code clean:
