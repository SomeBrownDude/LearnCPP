Things I learned with this project: 

    gdb: 
        Compile you code with -g flag to use gdb. gdb can help you find memory leaks and where segmentation errors occur

        How to use gdb: 
            Compile with -g flag
            Run gdb with 'gdb' command
            Type 'file <executable>' to open your file in gdb
            Use command 'run' to run your code with gdb and cause a segmentation fault
            Type 'bt' to find problems, alternatively you can also set break points and stuff

    Callgrind/Kcachegrind: 
        These tools can help you find performance issues
    
    .h .cpp files: 
        C++ classes should be defined with a .h file which you can include and a .cpp file with function implementations. 
    
    Keep Code clean: 
        Keep private functions, variables and public functions separate. 
        Separate large classes and include 
        Don't have unnecessary methods in public
        Use comments sparingly, honestly your code should be self-explanatory. 
    
    Position Class: 
        a Position class can be helpful for 2D games. 
        Just make a class with x and y variables. 
        You can add other basic functionality
    
    How to store coordinates: 
        Best to have a Position class and then convert coordinates to a 2d vector. 
        Then print the 2d vector. 
    
    Github: 
        git status 
        git add .
        git push 
        other cmds. 
        Enable Source Control on VScode and then you can see history. 
        Commit and push to github to save repository. 
        Or use desktop github app to push to repository

    Makefile: 
        makefile is very important and you can write a makefile which can work for pretty much any project: 
        eg: (There are better ones, just replace objs and target)
            CPPFLAGS = -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wfatal-errors -Wno-sign-compare -Wnon-virtual-dtor -g
            LDFLAGS=-lncurses

            OBJS = Clean.o
            TARGET = Clean

            OTHERFLAGS = -O2
            DEBUG = -g

            all: $(TARGET)

            $(TARGET): $(OBJS)
                g++ $(OTHERFLAGS) $(DEBUG) $(CPPFLAGS) -o $(TARGET) $(OBJS) $(OTHER) $(LDFLAGS) 

            %.o: %.cpp
                g++ $(CPPFLAGS) -c $<

            clean:
                rm -f $(OBJS) $(TARGET)
    
    ChatGPT is OP for debugging and learning coding. 
    
    A good clang-format file is useful: 
    eg: 
        BasedOnStyle: Google
        AccessModifierOffset: -4
        BreakBeforeBraces: Attach
        IndentWidth: 4
        AccessModifierOffset: -4
        ColumnLimit: 150
        AlignConsecutiveAssignments: true
        AlignOperands: true
        AlignTrailingComments: true
        AllowShortFunctionsOnASingleLine: true
        SpacesBeforeParens: Never
        BinPackArguments: false
        AllowShortIfStatementsOnASingleLine: false

    Make sure to either have Source Control, Git, or some other version history for you code in case everything breaks. 

    ncurses: 
        learned basic ncurses: 
        getch() = get user input eg while(input = getch());
        nodelay() = no delay for input getch() returns ERR
        noecho() = no printing input
        curs_set(0) = no cursor
        cbreak()
        initscr()
        endwin()
