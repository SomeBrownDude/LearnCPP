Things I learned with this project: 

    gdb: 
        Compile you code with -g flag to use gdb. gdb can help you find memory leaks and where segmentation errors occur

        How to use gdb: 
            Compile with -g flag
            Run gdb with 'gdb' command
            Type 'file <executable>' to open your file in gdb
            Use command 'run' to run your code with gdb and cause a segmentation fault
            Type 'bt' to find problems, alternative
